  <h1>Who I am?</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate Software Engineering student, currently pursuing my degree at the renowned Pak-Austria Fachhochschule Institute of Applied Science and Technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    My academic journey commenced with a strong foundation in programming, starting with a deep dive into the intricacies of C++ during my first semester. In my second semester, I further expanded my knowledge by mastering the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In my third semester, I successfully completed Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++, further enhancing my programming proficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
    My interest in web development led me to explore a variety of tools and languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I have successfully applied these skills in multiple web development projects during my internships.
  </p>
  <p>
    I kick-started my professional journey with an internship at Sabzland, followed by a remote web development internship at Oasis Infobyte. These experiences allowed me to develop hands-on skills in creating user-friendly, responsive websites. I further honed my skills during my recent internship at Entechin, where I contributed to both web and software development projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond technical skills, I am committed to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving software engineering landscape. I am excited to contribute to the tech industry, leveraging my expertise in web development and software solutions.
